# 🎓 ChatGPA MVP Strategy

**"Turn your messy notes into a cram session that actually works"**

---

## Core Positioning

**Target User:** College students panicking 3 days before an exam

**Use Case:** Emergency exam preparation, not long-term study habits

**Hook:** "Exam in 3 days? Upload notes → Get adaptive quizzes → Know exactly what you don't know yet"

**Competition:**
- NotebookLM: Great summaries, NO quizzes or exam prep
- Quizlet: Manual flashcards, NO AI adaptive grading
- ChatGPT: General purpose, NO memory of your classes

**Our Wedge:** Adaptive AI grading + Purpose-built for exam cramming

---

   - This is our moat - nail this feature

5. **Basic Dashboard**

## Why We're Keeping It Lean

**Goal:** Get 10 paying customers in 2-3 weeks

**Strategy:** 
1. Prove core value (notes → quiz → better grades)
2. Get revenue + testimonials
3. Add features based on what users actually ask for

**Not based on what we think is cool.**

---

## Week 1 Action Plan

### Day 1-3: Build Core Flow
- Note upload interface
- API integration (Claude for summary + quiz)
- Basic grading logic
- Display results

### Day 4-5: Add Payment
- Stripe checkout
- Usage limits (free tier vs paid)
- Simple dashboard to track classes

### Day 6-7: Get First Users
**Find 10 students with exams in next 2 weeks:**
- r/premed
- r/EngineeringStudents  
- r/APStudents
- College Discord servers

**Offer:** "Free beta access to AI exam prep tool. I'll give you lifetime premium if you test it and give feedback."

---

## Success Metrics (Week 1)

**Goal:** 10 students testing

**Validation:**
- 5+ say "this helped me study"
- 3+ ask "when can I pay for this?"
- 2+ would recommend to a friend

**If we hit this:** Scale up, add features users request

**If we miss:** Interview users, fix core value prop before adding features

---

## Phase 2 Features (Add After $1K MRR)

**Only build what users ask for:**

### Likely Requests:
1. **Progress tracking** - "How ready am I for this exam?"
2. **Spaced repetition** - "What should I review today?"
3. **More question types** - Fill-in-blank, true/false, essay prompts
4. **Study sessions** - Guided cram sessions with timer
5. **Mobile app** - Study on the go

### How to Prioritize:
- Count how many users request each feature
- Build top 3 most-requested
- Ignore "nice to haves"

---

## Phase 3 Features (After $5K MRR)

**Moat-building features:**

1. **Study Groups** (Network effects)
   - Students create study rooms
   - Share notes/quizzes
   - Compete on leaderboards

2. **Professor Integration** (Distribution moat)
   - Let professors create official class pages
   - Auto-assign quizzes to students
   - Class-wide analytics

3. **Learning Graph** (Data moat)
   - Track what each student struggles with
   - AI gets smarter with usage
   - Personalized weak point drilling

**These create switching costs. Build after proving core product works.**

---

## The Adaptive Grading Edge

**This is our superpower. Nail it.**

### Bad Grading (Competitors):
**Student:** "Mitochondria creates energy"
**AI:** "Incorrect. Try again."

### Good Grading (ChatGPA):
**Student:** "Mitochondria creates energy"
**ChatGPA:** 
> "✅ Concept correct: You understand the mitochondria's role in energy production
> 
> ⚠️ Terminology precision: The technical term is 'generates ATP through cellular respiration'
> 
> 💡 What to remember: You've got the WHAT (energy), tighten the HOW (ATP + cellular respiration)"

**This level of feedback is:**
- Encouraging (validates what they know)
- Educational (teaches what they missed)
- Actionable (tells them exactly what to fix)

**Competitors can't easily replicate this nuance.**

---

## Pricing Strategy

## Red Flags to Watch For

**If these happen, we need to pivot:**

1. **Users don't come back** (<30% return after first use)
   → Core value isn't strong enough

2. **Free users don't convert** (<5% free → paid)
   → Pricing is wrong OR free tier is too good

3. **Users say "I'll just use NotebookLM"**
   → We're not differentiated enough

4. **No organic word-of-mouth**
   → Product isn't remarkable enough to share

**If we hit these, we iterate or pivot. Don't force it.**

---

## Success Looks Like

**Week 3:** 10 beta users, 5+ say "this is helpful"
**Week 4:** 5 paying customers = $45-60 MRR
**Month 2:** 50 paying customers = $450 MRR
**Month 3:** 150 paying customers = $1,350 MRR
**Month 6:** 500 paying customers = $4,500 MRR

**At $5K MRR:** We've proven it works. Scale up or start Spontane.

---

## The One Thing That Matters

**Get 10 students to use ChatGPA this week.**

Everything else is secondary.

Not the name. Not the features. Not the polish.

**Just: Does it help students pass exams?**

If yes → we have a business.
If no → we iterate until it does.

---

## Remember

**We're not building a perfect product.**

**We're building the leanest version that solves one urgent problem:**

**"I have an exam in 3 days and I'm not ready."**

Everything else comes later.

Ship fast. Learn fast. Iterate fast.

Let's go. 🚀
