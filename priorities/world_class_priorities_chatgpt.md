After this plan (P0–P2, maybe P3), you’ll have a **complete, premium loop**. The next “world-class quiz generator” priorities are basically: **trust → quality → habit loop**.

Here’s the clean priority stack I’d run:

## P0 — Production Beta Hardening (must be true before marketing)

1. **Rate limiting + abuse guards** (generate + grade)

   * Prevent spam + runaway costs.
2. **Observability**

   * Basic error tracking + server logs you can actually use.
3. **Limits enforcement UX**

   * Free plan caps enforced + clear messages + upgrade path (not ugly).

## P1 — Generation Quality (highest leverage “world-class” feel)

4. **Input quality checks (smart warnings)**

   * You already add word count warning; extend to: “too many topics,” “no structure,” etc.
5. **Quiz quality rubric (auto QA)**

   * After generation, run a lightweight “sanity grader” pass: flag ambiguous questions, missing correct answers, duplicate questions.
6. **Better question diversity**

   * Ensure mix: recall + apply + explain (even without new minigames).

## P2 — Study Loop that Retains (world-class isn’t UI, it’s return behavior)

7. **Practice modes become first-class**

   * Practice incorrect (done), then:
   * Practice “weak topics” (based on tags / question grouping)
   * “Redo until mastery” session flow
8. **Attempts & progress history**

   * Not analytics porn — just: streak, last studied, weakest class, “continue studying” CTA.

## P3 — Onboarding that guarantees the first win

9. **First-run flow**

   * “Create class → paste notes → generate → take quiz” in <2 minutes
10. **Empty states**

* Every dead end becomes a guided next step.

## P4 — Expansion (only when the base is trusted)

11. **Feynman mode / mini-games**
12. **Calendar / planning**
13. **Sharing + export**

### The real “world-class” order (if you want it as a checklist)

1. Abuse guards
2. Logs/errors
3. Limits + upgrade UX
4. Quiz QA sanity pass
5. Diversity improvements
6. Progress/history loop
7. Onboarding polish

If you tell me what “world-class” means to you right now — **better questions** or **more retention** — I’ll pick the next 2 priorities and turn them into a Claude-ready plan.
