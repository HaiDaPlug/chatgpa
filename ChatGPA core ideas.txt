🧱 ChatGPA Core Ideas (MVP Edition)
💡 What Are We Selling Today

“An AI cram assistant that turns your messy notes into adaptive quizzes — so you know exactly what to focus on before your exam.”

That’s it.
Not a platform, not a second brain yet. Just the one thing that actually saves a student 4 hours of panic prep.

🎯 MVP Value Equation
Input	Output
Student uploads notes	AI summarizes them
	→ generates 5–10 adaptive quiz questions
	→ grades answers with contextual feedback
	→ shows exactly what they don’t know yet

✅ Time saved: no manual flashcards
✅ Clarity gained: what to study next
✅ Emotion delivered: relief + direction

That’s the most leverage for the least build time.

👥 ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
Attribute	Description
Who	College or high school students with an exam within 3–7 days
Psychology	Stressed, procrastinated, overwhelmed — but motivated now
Behavior	Has digital notes or slides; Googles “how to cram effectively”
Pain point	Too much material, too little time; doesn’t know where to start
Willingness to pay	$9–12 during exam week is a no-brainer if it actually helps

🧠 “I just want something that tells me what to study first.”

🧩 What’s the Minimum Build That Delivers Maximum Value
Must-Haves (the MVP spine)

Note upload (text or file)

Summary generation (Claude)

Quiz generation (5–10 Qs)

Adaptive grading feedback

Simple dashboard (classes + quizzes)

Stripe checkout

That’s your complete core loop.
Don’t overthink — just make that one loop solid and testable.

🚀 One Reddit Post (Validation Plan)

Goal: 10 students using it by this week.

Post idea:

“Exam in 3 days? I built an AI that turns your notes into quizzes and tells you what you don’t know yet. Want to test it free before launch?”

Subreddits: r/College, r/APStudents, r/EngineeringStudents, r/PreMed.

Include one screenshot of the grading feedback.

Offer “Free lifetime beta access for testers.”

That post will do more for validation than any design sprint or logo ever could.

🪞 Your Philosophy for This Phase

“Ship scrap now. Polish later.”
“No system, no brand — just product that helps.”
“Validation before perfection.”

The brand will emerge naturally once users start saying what the tool means to them.

🧠 What to Clear From Your Head

You don’t need mascot tone yet → Scrib comes back later.

You don’t need a full identity → ChatGPA name is already functional.

You don’t need retention loops → you need proof the value loop works once.

You don’t need community → you need feedback from 10 real students.

You are not building ChatGPA, the system.
You’re building ChatGPA, the proof.
