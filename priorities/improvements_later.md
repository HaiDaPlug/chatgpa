### 1) One-sentence “why you got it wrong”

Not a paragraph. A clean line like:

* “You mixed up **X** with **Y** — X is about ___, Y is about ___.”

### 2) “Next time, do this” suggestion

Give a tiny action:

* “Underline the keyword in the question (‘most likely’, ‘primary cause’) before answering.”

### 3) Partial credit that feels fair

When someone is “almost there,” show it:

* “Correct idea, missing the key detail: ___.”

### 4) Catch and fix trick questions

If a question is ambiguous, the app should admit it and correct itself:

* “This question was unclear. We won’t count it. Here’s a clearer version.”

That single behavior builds insane trust.

### 5) Wrong-answer patterns

After results, show 1–2 patterns max:

* “Most mistakes were about **definitions vs examples**.”
* “You’re strong on facts, weaker on applying them.”

### 6) Make practice feel smart, not repetitive

Practice incorrect-only is good. Add one more twist later:

* “Same concept, new question” (so it doesn’t feel like memorizing the answer).

### 7) Confidence check

Sometimes ask:

* “How sure were you?” (Low / Medium / High)
  Then results show:
* “High confidence + wrong = focus here.”

### 8) “Explain it like I’m teaching a friend”

A tiny optional prompt after a wrong answer:

* “Try explaining it in one sentence.”
  Then your AI responds with a better version.

### 9) Calm, friendly tone

No shame. No robotic scoring. Just:

* “Nice. You’re close.”
* “Good attempt — here’s the missing piece.”

### 10) Save the best stuff for the review page

Don’t overwhelm during the quiz. Keep the quiz flow fast, then let review be deep.

If you only do **two** of these, do **#4 (fix unfair questions)** and **#6 (new question, same concept)**. Those are the “this feels premium” moves users remember.

Got it. We’ll let it marinate.

If you’re optimizing for **“simple + great quiz generator”** (spot-on questions + grading + feedback), then the next priorities—*when you’re ready*—are basically:

1. **Question quality consistency** (avoid vague/ambiguous items, ensure correct answers are defensible)
2. **Feedback quality** (actionable, specific, points to *why* and *how to improve*)
3. **Grading reliability** (no weird misgrades, consistent rubric per question type)
